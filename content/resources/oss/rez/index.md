# Overview 

Rez is an open-source package manager designed for managing software environments in VFX, animation, and other complex production pipelines. It enables consistent, reproducible environments by resolving and deploying dependency graphs across multiple applications and tools.

I started using Rez while working on production pipelines at MPC / The Mill Paris, where it was a core component of the studio’s software ecosystem. I was responsible for creating, maintaining, and optimizing Rez packages for DCC applications, internal tools, and third-party libraries, ensuring stability and scalability across artist workstations and render farms.

Through this work, I gained a strong understanding of environment management, dependency resolution, and cross-platform deployment. I also contributed to improving internal workflows and tooling around Rez to better fit production constraints and evolving pipeline requirements.
