# Overview 

Blender is a free and open-source 3D creation suite that supports the entire 3D pipeline, including modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing, motion tracking, video editing, and game asset creation.

I started using Blender during the first year of my master’s work-study program. Later, after joining MPC / The Mill Paris, I was responsible for developing and maintaining the internal Blender production pipeline. In this role, I built multiple tools for the studio and began contributing to the Blender codebase around 2024 to address production issues encountered in real-world workflows.

In parallel, I developed several Blender [add-ons] to deepen my understanding of the Blender API and its integration within a production environment.
